# First steps

Terminal 1:
```
blender <absolute path to a default .blend> --python <absolute path to bpy/interface.py>
```

Terminal 2:
```
python3 interface.py (--np <noun phrase description of geometric object>)
```

This gets the Blender-specific Python setup talking with the core virtual environment of this project.


## Note
The tested performance is of OpenAI's gpt-4.1. (This should be an open-source, local, model)

To do is add the MDP and the RL algorithm (updating the above model with training).
